# [Project Name-Pothole Detector] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Hackonauts]


### Team Members
- Member 1: [Hiba Nasrin.P] - [EMEA College]
- Member 2: [Fathima Nidha.M] - [EMEA College]

### Project Description
[A browser-based web app that uses motion sensors to detect and count potholes in real time, helping raise road condition awareness. Future integration with route mapping could guide users to the smoothest, most convenient paths.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Road travelers often face unexpected potholes, causing damage, discomfort, and delays, with no simple way to check road conditions in advance.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[A web-based tool that detects potholes along a route and provides a mapped, safer, and smoother travel path.]
